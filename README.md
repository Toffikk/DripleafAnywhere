# Dripleaf Anywhere
![dripleafanywhere](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10419b13-f0ee-4cda-9eb7-d0dee959e756)


This plugin allows you to place big dripleaf blocks anywhere you imagine! Whether that is on fences, underwater or ontop of trees!

It allows mapmakers more freedom in making parkours and it can be useful for various redstone contraptions too!

 *Since the plugin uses only the API it should be fine to run on any new version in the foreseeable future, without requiring updates*
